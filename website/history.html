    <h1>History and Geography of West Africa</h1>
    <h2>History</h2>
    <p> People lived in West Africa for hundreds of thousands of years as hunter-gather tribes then eventually formed larger groups of people and expanded their territory. Medieval empires in West Africa were very powerful, in 1300 at it's peak the Empire
        of Mali was the wealthiest empire in Africa. In the Renaissance Portugeses slave traders set up establishments in West Africa and began the slave trade soon after. In the 18 and 1900's a number of nations colonized Africa, including France, the
        Netherlands, England, and more.</p>
    <h2>Geography</h2>

        city is Lagos, Nigeria.</p>
