    <h1>Culture of the Akan and Mande People</h1>
    <p>The Akan and Mande people have a caste system, where people are born into castes based on their ancestor's caste and don't leave. The caste system was based around a social hierarchy wher some castes were mere powerful than others.The musician caste
        was known as the Jeli. The Jeli were highly valuable but didn't have a lot of resources. They preserved history and culture. In Akan and Mande culture people lived near their mothers, and their caste was determined by what their mother did instead
        of teir fathers. Also the Akan and Mande people lived in small groups/tribes. Today, Ghana's government is based on the indigenous practices from many centuries ago.</p>
